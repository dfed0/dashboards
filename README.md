# Everything related to the DB has been removed so as not to show sensitive data


Dashboards is a web application developed in Angular that implements a system of dashboards (control panels) with the ability to visualise data, edit them and dynamically display content. The project uses Firebase as a backend solution (authentication, database, hosting), which allows to conveniently scale the application and store user data. 

# The current Firebase implementation includes some suboptimal solutions. All Firebase-related code will be refactored or removed in favor of a more robust architecture based on MongoDB and modern backend practices.
